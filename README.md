## üß† Core Architecture

This application is built around two intelligent systems:

1. Personalized Analytics Engine: All user interactions with flashcards are meticulously tracked and stored locally. This data powers a dashboard that visualizes learning progress and generates a personalized study path, highlighting areas that need more attention and celebrating mastered topics.
2. AI Quiz & Explanation Generator: The app uses Google Gemini to enhance the learning process. When a user requests a quiz, the AI analyzes the selected flashcards to generate relevant multiple-choice questions and challenging distractors. If a user answers incorrectly, the AI provides a detailed, context-aware explanation to clarify the concept and prevent future mistakes. All AI-generated content is cached to ensure a fast and seamless user experience.
