      "back": "Use file storage. It supports a folder-based hierarchy and is ideal for shared access scenarios such as development environments and user directories.",
      "example": "An AWS Elastic File System (EFS) is mounted to multiple EC2 instances, each reading and writing to shared code repositories.",
