      "front": "Your organization wants to grant employees temporary credentials when accessing AWS, instead of long-term credentials. What IAM feature should you use?",
      "back": "Use IAM roles, which provide temporary security credentials that automatically expire, making them safer than permanent user credentials.",
      "example": "Instead of giving developers access keys, they assume a 'DevAccess' role and receive temporary credentials that expire in 1 hour.",
