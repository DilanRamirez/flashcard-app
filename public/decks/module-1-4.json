    "front": "What is the AWS root user?",
    "back": "The identity created with the email and password when you sign up for an AWS account, which has unrestricted access to all resources and billing.",
    "example": "When I first created my AWS account, I logged in as the root user using my signup email and password.",

    "front": "What credentials are associated with the AWS root user?",
    "back": "Two sets: the console credentials (email address and password) and access keys (access key ID and secret access key) for CLI/API calls.",
    "example": "I use my root user’s email/password for console login and delete its access keys to avoid programmatic access risks.",

    "front": "Why must you protect the AWS root user?",
    "back": "Because it has full, unrestricted permissions; if compromised, an attacker can delete data, spin up resources, and incur charges.",
    "example": "A hacker who obtains my root credentials could delete all my S3 buckets and launch expensive EC2 instances.",

    "front": "What is multi-factor authentication (MFA)?",
    "back": "An authentication method requiring two or more different factors—something you know, have, or are—to verify identity.",

    "back": "Something you know (e.g., password), something you have (e.g., MFA device), and something you are (e.g., fingerprint).",
    "example": "Using a password, an MFA code from my phone, and a fingerprint scan covers all three factors.",

    "front": "What is the difference between authentication and authorization?",
    "back": "Authentication verifies identity (“Are you who you say you are?”); authorization determines permissions (“What can you do?”).",
    "example": "Logging in confirms my identity; assigning me an IAM role determines what AWS actions I can perform.",
