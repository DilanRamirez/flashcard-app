      "back": "You can make API calls via the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs.",

      "front": "What is the AWS Management Console?",
      "back": "A web-based graphical interface where you log in and click through services to create and manage AWS resources.",
      "example": "I launched an EC2 instance by clicking through the EC2 dashboard in the console.",

      "front": "How does the AWS CLI help with automation?",
      "back": "You can script CLI commands and schedule them to run regularly, eliminating manual console work and adapting to dynamic environments.",
      "example": "I set up a daily cron job that uses the AWS CLI to back up EC2 instance data.",
      "mnemonic": "Scripted C = Cron + CLI",

      "id": "7",
      "front": "What are AWS SDKs?",
      "back": "Open-source language libraries maintained by AWS that let developers call AWS APIs directly from their application code.",
