      "front": "Why should you upload critical files like photos to AWS instead of storing them only on your laptop?",
      "back": "Uploading to AWS ensures redundant copies exist in data centers, protecting against laptop failure and enabling access from anywhere.",
      "example": "I uploaded my family photos to an S3 bucket so I can view them from my phone even if my laptop crashes.",
      "mnemonic": "S3 = Safe & Secure Storage",

      "front": "What is an AWS Availability Zone (AZ)?",
      "back": "A group of one or more data centers within a region, connected by redundant power and networking, providing high availability.",
      "example": "We deployed our web servers in two AZs to stay online even if one data center has an outage.",

      "back": "Compliance requirements, latency to users, regional pricing, and availability of services in that region.",
      "example": "We picked the Oregon region because it met our low-latency needs and offered the newest services at a good price.",
      "mnemonic": "CLPS: Compliance, Latency, Price, Services",

      "front": "Why is compliance the first factor when selecting an AWS region?",
      "back": "Regulatory or legal requirements may mandate data to remain within specific geographic boundaries.",
      "example": "Our healthcare app must store patient data in the Canada Central region to meet Canadian privacy laws.",
      "mnemonic": "Constraint Comes First",

    },
    {
      "id": "sfddfsd7",
      "front": "How does latency influence AWS region choice?",
      "back": "Lower latency is achieved by placing resources closer to end users, improving application responsiveness.",
      "example": "We host our gaming servers in the Oregon region to minimize delay for West Coast players.",
      "mnemonic": "Latency = Location",
      "category": "Latency",

      "front": "What is service availability in an AWS region?",
      "back": "Not all AWS services launch in every region immediately, so you must verify needed services exist where you plan to run.",
      "example": "We delayed using a new AI service until it was available in our chosen region.",
      "mnemonic": "Check Services First",

      "example": "Our website uses CloudFront to deliver images from the nearest Edge location, speeding up page loads for global visitors.",
      "mnemonic": "Edge = Everywhere Delivery",
